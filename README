This Makefile builds a executable "app" and it's libraries together
Each Directory within the source directory specified by 'srcdir' is a library named of after the directory name.
All c++-files in the directory represent the library and are compiled into a shared ao static archive library depending on variable value of 'SHARED'
all c++-files directly inside the Source Directory are compiled and liked with the built libraries to make the executable.

This would represent the structure:
==========
<current directory>
	|
	|-<Source Directory (srcdir)>
	|	|-<Library Directories>*
	|	|	|-<C++ files>*
	|	|	|-<Config file (LIBCONFIGFILE)>
	|	|
	|	|-<C-files>*
	|	|-<Config file (MAINCONFIG)>
	|
	|-<Build Directory>
	|	|-<Library Directories>*
	|	|	|-<Make files>*
	|	|	|-<Object Files>*
	|	|	|-<Timstamp file>
	|	|
	|	|-<Object files>*
	|	|-<Make files>*
	|	|-<Library Files (named after Directories)>*
	|	|-<executable>
	|	|-<Install timstamp>
	|
	|-<Makefile>

note: * at the end signifies more than one.

To gain additional control over build proccess the following variables can be set from commandline:

#====Compiler flags====#
CXX		(defualt 'gcc')
CXXLIBS		(defualt no value)
CXXFLAGS		(defualt '-g -O -Wall')
RPATH		(defualt automatically set to location of build (or Install path))
AR		(defualt 'ar')
ARFLAGS		(defualt 'crs')
#====Install configuration====#
prefix		(/usr/local/)
DESTDIR		(defualt no value)
#====Program name====#
prog_name	(defualt 'main')
#====Other Values====#
SHARED		(defualt no value (any value tells makefile to create shared libraries))
#====================#

These variables must not be modified from commandline (they will be ignored if you try, and defualt value will be used)
srcdir		(defualt src/)
buildir		(defualt buld/)
INSTALL		(defualt 'install -D -p')
INSTALL_PROGRAM	(defualt 'install -D -p - 755')
INSTALL_DATA	(defualt 'install -D -p -m 644')
bindir		(defualt '$(prefix)/bin')
libdir		(defualt '$(prefix)/lib')
...
etc
